# A Whole New World
ICS4U0 Final ISP,

An interactive storyline game that will assist immigrant families in their challenges of moving to a new country.

When we were assigned the challenge of making an interactive game that focused on world challenges we decided to create a game that stimulates the challenges that children face when immigrating to a new country, as all of us had experienced this and continue to experience it. Our game takes players through 3 different levels/challenges, some of these include learning a whole new language for the first time and working hard to make money.
